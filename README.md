# Stopwatch Web Application
# Overview
This project is part of my Byte Uprise Web Development Internship. The Stopwatch Web Application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to measure time intervals with options to start, pause, reset, and record lap times.

# Features
Start: Initiates the stopwatch, updating the time in real-time.
Pause: Pauses the stopwatch without resetting the current time.
Reset: Resets the stopwatch to zero, clearing any recorded lap times.
Lap Times: Records and displays lap times as the stopwatch runs.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including the display, buttons, and lap time section.
CSS: Styles the application with a clean, responsive layout.
JavaScript: Implements the core stopwatch functionalities (start, pause, reset, and lap time recording).

# How It Works
Start: When the user clicks the "Start" button, the timer begins counting and updates the display every 10 milliseconds.
Pause: Clicking "Pause" halts the timer without resetting the current time.
Reset: Clicking "Reset" returns the stopwatch to 00:00:00 and clears all recorded lap times.
Lap: The "Lap" button records the current time and adds it to the list of lap times displayed below the stopwatch.
